This study demonstrated that detection of PD-L1+ CTCs using a CSV-enrichment method has promising value as a clinically relevant prognostic marker for GC. [PMID:31981446] We found that inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNAs increased the levels of PD-L1 in cultured gastric cancer cells and in xenografts. Mechanistically, autophagy inhibition led to the accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB, in which NF-kB inhibition or p62/SQSTM1 knockdown attenuated PD-L1 induction by autophagy inhibition. Immunohistochemical staining of primary tumor tissues of 137 patients with gastric cancer showed that LC3 and p62/SQSTM1 protein levels were positively correlated with PD-L1 (LC3, p < 0.001; p62/SQSTM1, p < 0.05). The expression of PD-L1 was also positively correlated with tumor lymphocyte infiltration (p < 0.001). We discovered that autophagy regulates PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer through the p62/SQSTM1-NF-kB pathway. Pharmacological modulation of autophagy may thus influence the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in gastric cancer. [PMID:30925913]",,CD274

Genes expressed only in cancer tissue, and especially on the cell membrane, will be useful molecular markers for diagnosis and may also be good therapeutic targets. To identify genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC, we generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from two GC cell lines and normal stomach. By sequencing 4320 colonies from CAST libraries, we identified 30 candidate genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of these candidates revealed that ZDHHC14, BST2, DRAM2, and DSC2 were expressed much more highly in GC than in 14 kinds of normal tissues. Among these, DSC2 encodes desmocollin 2, which is one of three known desmocollins. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 22 (28%) of 80 GC cases were positive for desmocollin 2, and desmocollin 2 expression was observed frequently in GC with the intestinal mucin phenotype. Furthermore, desmocollin 2 expression was correlated with CDX2 expression.
